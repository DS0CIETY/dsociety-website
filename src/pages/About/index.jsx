        Just a group of those who want to change or create something. We're trying to start doing something useful, and
        it doesn't depend on your ability. It's like a hobby that can become something big. There are no deadlines, no
        clear rules.

        Everyone has their own, but everyone can offer something to improve our society, change something, maybe the
